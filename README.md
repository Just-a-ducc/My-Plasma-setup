# My-Plasma-setup
Some folks on the linuxmasterrace subreddit asked about my setup so here you go. If you don't use Linux, consider switching if you ever want to have a nice (and functional) desktop :p

I don't remember every single setting but here's everything that you'll (hopefully) need to do:

Steps:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


•Install Krohnkite Kwin script.


•Enable configuration for it (tutorial in the Krohnkite Github page).


•Set gaps to 10 pixels everywhere in Krohnkite config.


•Install Gently (global theme) and Ocean (Plasma style) and McMuse-circle-green-dark icons from Plasma settings.


•Apply the Gently global theme, change Plasma style to Ocean and set the icons to MsMuse.


•Set custom shortcuts to close, minimize and maximize your windows in Settings->Shortcuts->Global shortcuts->Kwin


•I'd recommend having screen edges setup to Desktop Grid for the bottom left and Show desktop for the bottom right. 


*Go to Settings->Application Style->Window Decorations->Titlebar Buttons and hide everything (make sure theme is Gently Blur)


•Install Kvantum manager.


•My Konsole theme is CandyFloss


•Download Tensent theme for Kvantum, install and apply it.


•Set the font to Source Code Pro Semibold 12pt in Plasma settings->Fonts->Adjust all fonts (and your program settings in case they don't follow).


•This isn't shown here but my GTK theme is Gently-Breeze


•Install latte-dock-git and launch it


•Add a top panel (alignment=justify, margins->screen=10px, opacity=40%, absolute size=32px) with these widgets:

    • Simple Menu
    • Latte spacer (8px)
    • Sticky note (translucent with light text)
    • Latte spacer (8px)
    • Global Menu
    • The two justify splitters
    • Media player
    • Latte spacer (8px)
    • Better Inline Clock (font size->custom=18, date format="ddd d,MMM | ")
    • One more Latte spacer (8px)
    • System tray (set everything to always hidden)
    • 
*all widgets either come with Plama or can be instaled from "get new widgets".


•Add a dock with the same settings of the panel but the alignment to center and add an icon only task manager from widget.
